### Description
>This provides the supporting document and multimedia materials for the paper "Continuous Bimanual Trajectory Decoding of Coordinated Movement from EEG Signals". 
>>The supporting document includes the correlation coefficient (CC) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) after 10-fold cross-validation on each subject for both bimanual session (both-hands movement) and unimanual session (left- and right-hand movement). The results of all 13 subjects were presented in Tables SI and SII.

>>Supplementary Movie_S1 (10.3MB) shows the experimental setup and how the actual hands control the moving of circles on the monitor by Leap Motion device.
>>Supplementary Movie_S2 (20.9MB) shows one bimanual run, which includes 15 trials.
>>Supplementary Movie_S3 (19.8MB) shows one unimanual run (left hand), which includes 15 trials.
>>Supplementary Movie_S4 (19.7MB) shows one unimanual run (right hand), which includes 15 trials.
