# Continuous Bimanual Trajectory Decoding of Coordinated Movement from EEG Signals
## supporting document for the paper "Continuous Bimanual Trajectory Decoding of Coordinated Movement from EEG Signals"
The document provides the correlation coefficient (CC) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) after 10-fold cross-validation on each subject for both bimanual session (both-hands movement) and unimanual session (left- and right-hand movement). The results of all 13 subjects were presented in Tables SI and SII.
